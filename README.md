# purpose:

The project aims to create an interactive dashboard where her volunteers can select their anonymized ID from a dropdown menu in the browser to display information about their belly button critters.

A dropdown menu will list the ID numbers of all the volunteers. When a volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu, that person's demographic information, such as location, sex, and age, will be displayed.

We have created a dynamic bar, bubble, and gauge chart with the dropdown menu in the browser with different Ids. When an Id is selected, the browser will display the graph for the dataset associated with that option.
